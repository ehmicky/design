# Trademark Guidelines

## Introduction

This document, the "Policy," outlines the policy for the use of our trademarks
in "Autoserver", "keep-func-props", "log-process-errors", "portable node.js" and "unix-permissions"
(each referred to as the "Project").

While our software is available under a free and open source software license,
the copyright license does not include an implied right or license to use our
trademark.

The role of trademarks is to provide assurance about the quality of the
products or services with which the trademark is associated. But because
an open source license allows your unrestricted modification of the
copyrighted software, we cannot be sure that your modifications to the
software are ones that will not be misleading if distributed under the
same name. Instead, this Policy describes the circumstances under which
you may use our trademarks.

In this Policy we are not trying to limit the lawful use of our
trademarks, but rather describe for you what we consider the parameters
of lawful use to be. Trademark law can be ambiguous, so we hope to
provide enough clarity for you to understand whether we will consider
your use licensed or non-infringing.

The sections that follow describe what trademarks are covered by this
Policy, as well as uses of the trademarks that are allowed without
additional permission from us. If you want to use our trademarks in ways
that are not described in this Policy, please see ["Where to get further
information"](#where-to-get-further-information) below for
contact information. Any use that does not comply with this Policy or
for which we have not separately provided written permission is not a
use that we have approved, so you must decide for yourself whether the
use is nevertheless lawful.

## Our commitment to open source principles

We want to encourage and facilitate the use of our trademarks by the
community, but do so in a way that still ensures that the trademarks are
meaningful as a source and quality indicator for our software and the
associated goods and services and continue to embody the high reputation
of the software and the community associated with it. This Policy
therefore tries to strike the proper balance between: 1) our need to
ensure that our trademarks remain reliable indicators of the qualities
that they are meant to preserve and 2) our community members' desire to
be full participants in the Project.

## Trademarks subject to the guidelines

### Our trademarks

This Policy covers:

1\. Our word trademarks and service marks (the "Word Marks"):

| Mark               | Common descriptive name for the goods or services      |
| :----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Autoserver         | Create a full-featured REST/GraphQL API from a configuration file |
| keep-func-props    | Wrap a function without changing its name, length and other properties |
| log-process-errors | Show some ❤️ to Node.js process errors                  |
| portable node.js   | Practical guide on how to write portable/cross-platform Node.js code |
| unix-permissions   | Swiss Army knife for Unix permissions                  |

2\. Our logos (the "Logos"):

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ehmicky/design/master/autoserver/autoserver.svg?sanitize=true" width="550"/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ehmicky/design/master/keep-func-props/keep-func-props.svg?sanitize=true" width="400"/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ehmicky/design/master/log-process-errors/log-process-errors.svg?sanitize=true" width="400"/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ehmicky/design/master/portable-node-guide/portable-node-guide.png?sanitize=true" width="550"/>

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ehmicky/design/master/unix-permissions/unix-permissions.png?sanitize=true" width="550"/>

3\. And the unique visual styling of our website and packaging (the
"Trade Dress").

This Policy encompasses all trademarks and service marks, whether Word
Marks, Logos or Trade Dress, which are collectively referred to as the
Marks.” Some Marks may not be registered, but registration does not
equal ownership of trademarks. This Policy covers our Marks whether they
are registered or not.

## Universal considerations for all uses

Whenever you use one of the Marks, you must always do so in a way that
does not mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about exactly
what they are getting and from whom. The law reflects this requirement
in two major ways described in more detail
[below](#what-trademark-law-is-about): it prohibits creating
a ["likelihood of confusion"](#what-is-likelihood-of-confusion) but allows
for ["nominative use."](#what-is-nominative-use) For
example, you cannot say you are distributing "the Project"
when you're distributing a modified version of it, because people would
be confused when they are not getting the same features and
functionality they would get if they downloaded the software directly
from us. You also cannot use our logo on your website in a way that
suggests that your website is an official website or that we endorse
your website. You can, though, say you like "the Project",
that you participate in "the Project" community, that you are
providing an unmodified version of "the Project", or that
you wrote a book describing how to use "the Project".

This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what
they are getting and from whom, is reflected throughout this Policy. It
should also serve as your guide if you are not sure about how you are
using the Marks.

In addition:

You may not use the Marks in association with the use or distribution of
software if you are also not in compliance with the copyright license
for the software.

You may not use or register, in whole or in part, the Marks as part of
your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name,
product name or service name.

Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are
too similar to ours. You therefore may not use an obvious variation of
any of our Marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language
equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product
or service. We would consider the following too similar to one of our
Marks:

\<\<Example for UBUNTU: "Any mark ending with the letters UBUNTU or
BUNTU"\>\>
\<\<Example for ARCHLINUX: "Any mark beginning with the letters
ARCH"\>\>
You agree that you will not acquire any rights in the Marks and that any
goodwill generated by your use of the Marks inures solely to our
benefit.

## Use for software

See [Universal considerations for all uses](#universal-considerations-for-all-uses), above, which
also apply.

### Uses we consider non-infringing

#### Distribution of unmodified source code or unmodified executable code we have compiled

When you redistribute an unmodified copy of our software, you are not
changing the quality or nature of it. Therefore, you may retain the Word
Marks and the Logos we have placed on the software to identify your
redistribution -- whether that redistribution is made by optical media,
memory stick or download of unmodified source and executable code. This
kind of use only applied if you are redistributing an official
distribution from this Project that has not been changed in any way. You
can find files for the Logos and approved designs for packaging on this
repository.

#### Distribution of executable code that you have compiled, or modified code

You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe
the origin of the software that you are providing, that is, that the
code you are distributing is a modification of our software. You may
say, for example, that "this software is derived from the source code
for Autoserver."

\<\<Example \#1: This source code is distributed with an
"--enable-official-branding" flag. By default, this software will
compile without official branding. As long as you do not modify the code
or enable this flag before compiling, any use of the Autoserver in
the compiled code is noninfringing.\>\>

Of course, you can place your own trademarks or logos on versions of the
software to which you have made substantive modifications, because by
modifying the software you have become the origin of that exact version.
In that case, you should not use our Logos. Our source code version
therefore does not contain our Logo data files.

#### Statements about compatibility, interoperability or derivation

You may use the Word Marks, but not the Logos, to truthfully describe
the relationship between your software and ours. Our Mark should be used
after a verb or preposition that describes the relationship between your
software and ours. So you may say, for example, "Bob's software for the
Autoserver platform" but may not say "Bob's Autoserver
software." Some other examples that may work for you are:

\[Your software\] works with Autoserver
\[Your software\] uses Autoserver
\[Your software\] is compatible with Autoserver
\[Your software\] is powered by Autoserver
\[Your software\] runs on Autoserver
\[Your software\] for use with Autoserver
\[Your software\] for Autoserver

#### Use of trademarks to show community affiliation

This section discusses the use of our Marks for software such an
application themes, skins and personas. The use of our Marks on websites
is discussed below.

You may use the Word Marks and the Logos in themes, personas, or skins
for applications to show your support for the Project, provided that the
use is non-commercial and the use is clearly decorative, as contrasted
with a use that appears to be the branding for a website or application.

### Uses for which we are granting a license

#### Distribution of modified software

\<\<Example \#1: You may use the Word Marks and the Logos for the
distribution of code (source or executable) on the condition that any
executable is built from the official Project source code and that any
modifications are limited to switching on or off features already
included in the software, translations into other languages, and
incorporating bug-fix patches.\>\>

\<\<Example \#2: You may use the Word Marks and the Logos for the
distribution of executable code on the condition that it is made from
official Project source code using the procedure documented for creating
an executable found at \<\<location of build instructions.\>\>\>\>

#### Distribution of software preloaded on hardware

\<\<Example \#1: You may use the Word Marks and the Logos in association
with hardware devices on the condition that the executable installed on
the device is the official source executable for the Project, and that
you do not suggest that the Project is the source of the hardware device
itself but rather than the Marks are for the software incorporated into
the device.\>\>

\<\<Example \#2: You may use use the Word Marks and the Logos in
association with hardware devices on the condition that the software
installed on the device is modified only so far as necessary to operate
on the hardware platforms and the essential functions of the software
are unchanged, and that you do not suggest that the Project is the
source of the hardware device itself but rather than the Marks are for
the software incorporated into the device.\>\>

### Uses we consider infringing without seeking further permission from us

We will likely consider using the Marks in a software distribution that
combines our software with any other software program an infringement of
our Marks. We would consider your software "combined" with ours if you
create a single executable for both software programs, as well as if by
installing our software it automatically installs yours. We would not
consider your software "combined" with ours if it is on the same media
but requires separate, independent action to install it.

## Use for non-software goods and services

See [Universal considerations for all uses](#universal-considerations-for-all-uses), above, which
also apply.

### Uses we consider non-infringing

#### Websites

You may use the Word Marks and Logos, but not the Trade Dress, on your
webpage to show your support for the Project as long as:

  - The website has branding that is easily distinguished from the
    Project Trade Dress;
  - You own branding or naming is more prominent than any Project Marks;
  - The Logos hyperlink to the Project website;
  - The site does not mislead customers into thinking that either your
    website, service, or product is our website, service, or product;
    and
  - The site clearly states that you are not affiliated with or endorsed
    by the Project.

#### Publications and presentations

You can use the Word Marks in book and article titles, and the Logo in
illustrations within the document, as long as the use does not suggest
that we have published, endorse, or agree with your work.

#### Events

You can use the signage in this repository to promote the
software and Project at events.

### Uses for which we are granting a license

#### User groups

You can use the Word Marks as part of your user group name provided
that:

  - The main focus of the group is the software;
  - Any software or services the group provides are without cost;
  - The group does not make a profit;
  - Any charge to attend meetings are to cover the cost of the venue,
    food and drink only.

Note that the [Universal considerations for all uses](#universal-considerations-for-all-uses), above, still
apply, specifically, that you may not use or register the Marks as part
of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade
name, product name or service name.

#### Promotional goods

"Promotional goods" are non-software goods that use the Marks and that
are intended to advertise the Project, promote the Project, or show
membership in the Project community.

\<\<Example \#1\>\> You may make promotional goods for free giveaway at
open source conferences and events using only the designs found on this
repository.

\<\<Example \#2\>\> You may make promotional goods for free giveaway at
open source conferences and events provided that the goods are obtained
from \<\<contractor for promotional goods.\>\>

### Uses we consider infringing without seeking further permission from us

We will likely consider using the Marks as part of a domain name or
subdomain an infringement of our Marks.

We would likely consider using the Marks on promotional goods for sale
an infringement of our Marks.

## General Information

### Trademark marking and legends

The first or most prominent mention of a Mark on a webpage, document,
packaging, or documentation should be accompanied by a symbol indicating
whether the mark is a registered trademark ("®") or an unregistered
trademark ("™"). See our [Trademark List](#our-trademarks)
for the correct symbol to use.

Also, if you are using our Marks in a way described in the sections
"Uses for which we are granting a license," please put following notice
at the foot of the page where you have used the Mark (or, if in a book,
on the credits page), on any packaging or labeling, and on advertising
or marketing materials: "the Project is trademark of
ehmicky, registered in the European Union and other
countries".

### What to do when you see abuse

If you are aware of any confusing use or misuse of the Marks in any way,
we would appreciate you bringing this to our attention. Please contact
us as described [below](#where-to-get-further-information)
so that we can investigate it further.

### Where to get further information

If you have any questions about this Policy, would like to speak with us
about the use of our Marks in ways not described in the Policy, or see
any abuse of our Marks, please \<\<insert contact information.\>\>

## General considerations about trademarks and their use

### What trademark law is about

#### What is a trademark?

A trademark is a word, phrase, symbol or design, or a combination of
words, phrases, symbols or designs, that identifies and distinguishes
the source of the goods of one party from those of others. A service
mark is the same as a trademark, except that it identifies and
distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product. "Trade
dress" or "get up" refers to the look and feel of the packaging, which
in this context can include the layout, colors, images, and design
choices in a web page. Throughout this Policy, the terms "trademark" and
"mark" refer to both trademarks, service marks and trade dress.

However, the use of a word is "not as a trademark" when it is used
functionally as part of the software program, for example, in a file,
folder, directory, or path name. Use in this way is not a trademark
infringement.

#### What is "likelihood of confusion"?

There is trademark infringement if your use of a trademark has created a
"likelihood of confusion." This means using a trademark in a way that
will likely confuse or deceive the relevant consuming public about the
source of a product or service using the mark in question. For example,
if the "Foo" software extension removes all double spaces after periods,
but someone else later creates "Foo" software that adds a third space
after periods, consumers would be confused between the two and the
newcomer will likely be a trademark infringer. As another example, if a
company makes "Foobar" software and a third party offers training called
"Foobar Certification," a person is likely to believe, wrongly, that the
certification is being offered by the makers of Foobar software. The
third party has likely misled consumers about the source of its training
and is a trademark infringer.

#### What is "nominative" use?

So-called "nominative use" (or "nominative fair use"), which is the name
of the doctrine under U.S. trademark law, allows the use of another's
trademark where it is necessary for understanding. Other countries'
trademark laws also have similar provisions. For example, a car repair
shop that specializes in a particular brand of automobile, VW for
example, must be allowed to say that they repair VW cars. Here is what
you should consider when deciding whether your use of a trademark is a
nominative fair use:

  - Whether you can identify the product or service in question without
    using the trademark;
  - Whether you are avoiding a likelihood of confusion in the way that
    you have used the trademark; and
  - Whether you have used only as much as is necessary to identify the
    product or service.

With our "Foobar Certification" example above, the person offering the
certification would be allowed to say, under the nominative fair use
doctrine, that she is offering "Maude's Certification for Foobar
software."

It is almost never the case that using a Logo will be a nominative fair
use since it will be a rare case where the logo is needed for strictly
informational purposes.

### Proper trademark use

These rules hold true for all trademarks, not just ours, so you should
follow them for our Marks as well as anyone else's.

#### Use of trademarks in text

**Always distinguish trademarks from surrounding text with at least
initial capital letters or in all capital letters.**<br>
Unacceptable: \<\<\~mark\>\><br>
Acceptable: \<\<\~Mark, \~MARK\>\>

**Always use trademarks in their exact form with the correct spelling,
neither abbreviated, hyphenated, or combined with any other word or
words.**<br>
Unacceptable: \<\<\~Mark misspelled or wrong case\>\><br>
Acceptable: \<\<\~Mark\>\>

**Don't pluralize a trademark.**<br>
Unacceptable: I have seventeen \<\<\~Marks\>\> running in my lab.<br>
Acceptable: I have seventeen \<\<\~Mark\>\> systems running in my lab.

**Don't use "a" or "the" to refer to an instance of the trademark.**<br>
Unacceptable: I put a \<\<\~Mark\>\> on my mom's computer.<br>
Acceptable: I put a \<\<\~Mark\>\> system on my mom's computer.

**Always use a trademark as an adjective modifying a noun.** You can see
the nouns we prefer under ["Our trademarks."](#our-trademarks)<br>
Unacceptable: This is a \<\<\~Mark\>\>. Anyone can install it.<br>
Acceptable: This is a \<\<\~Mark\>\> application. Anyone can install it.

**Don't use a trademark as a verb. Trademarks are products or services,
never actions.**<br>
Unacceptable: I \<\<\~Markified\>\> my computer today\!<br>
Acceptable: I installed \<\<\~Mark\>\> software on my computer today\!

**Don't use a trademark as a possessive. Instead, the following noun
should be used in possessive form or the sentence reworded so there is
no possessive.**<br>
Unacceptable: \<\<\~Mark's\>\> desktop interface is very clean.<br>
Acceptable: The \<\<\~Mark\>\> desktop's interface is very clean.

**Don't translate a trademark into another language.**<br>
Acceptable: Quiero instalar \<\<\~Mark\>\> en mi sistema.<br>
Unacceptable: Quiero instalar \<\<\~Mark translated into Spanish\>\> en
mi sistema.

#### Use of Logos

You may not change any Logo except to scale it. This means you may not
add decorative elements, change the colors, change the proportions,
distort it, add elements, or combine it with other logos.

However, when the context requires the use of black-and-white graphics
and the logo is color, you may reproduce the logo in a manner that
produces a black-and-white image.
